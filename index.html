         <h1>Homelessness</h1>
         <p>Homelessness is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects individuals and families across all demographics. At its core, homelessness means not having a stable, safe, and adequate place to live. It's not just about lacking a physical shelter; it encompasses a range of challenges and hardships that impact every aspect of a person's life. Moreover, homelessness is not limited to those living on the streets. It also includes individuals and families who are precariously housed, living in overcrowded or substandard conditions, or couch-surfing with friends and relatives. The invisible nature of this type of homelessness often goes unnoticed but can be just as devastating.</p>
